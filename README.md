# gpu-web-scraper
Web scraping Canadian GPU sellers to display on a Django site 

# TODO:
- scrape other websites (best buy, canada computers, etc.)
  - pass dataframe object to each scraper so it can add to the dataframe?
- style site so its not ugly
- make site display X amount of products at once
- search bar?
- way to sort the columns? -> ex. sort by pricing
